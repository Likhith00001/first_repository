basiclly git is repository of new and old change .that can be reflacted after the period of time which created old version that can be taken back to the action.
then we can work in the community and change and recovere the work and store them as the repository
  


git --version
git status 'to check existing repository
git init 'for using current repository as git repository
ls 'to get details of list of all files

there is working directory we need change it to git directory by taking them to status bar by command

git add . ' to change directory to git directory

git commit -m "version 1" 'for to see chamges detailes of commited change in the file

 git config --global user.email "you@example.com" 'to add an user globely or local
 git config --global user.name "you" ' to name globle or local user

git log ' to see who logged in and changed the directory
